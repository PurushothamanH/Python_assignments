    "1. Bayesian Interpretation of Probability\n",
    "Definition: The Bayesian interpretation defines probability as a measure of belief or confidence in the occurrence of an event, which can be updated as new information becomes available.\n",
    "Example: If initially, you believe there’s a 60% chance it will rain tomorrow, and then you learn of a coming storm, you may update that probability to 90%.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Probability of a Union of Two Events\n",
    "Definition: The probability of the union of two events 𝐴 A and 𝐵 B, denoted as (𝐴∪𝐵)P(A∪B), is the probability that at least one of the events occurs.\n",
    "Equation: 𝑃(𝐴∪𝐵)=𝑃(𝐴)+𝑃(𝐵)−𝑃(𝐴∩𝐵) P(A∪B)=P(A)+P(B)−P(A∩B)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Joint Probability\n",
    "Definition: Joint probability is the probability that two events, 𝐴A and 𝐵B, both occur simultaneously.\n",
    "Formula: 𝑃(𝐴∩𝐵)P(A∩B)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Chain Rule of Probability\n",
    "Definition: The chain rule of probability expresses the probability of a sequence of events in terms of conditional probabilities.\n",
    "Formula: For events 𝐴A, 𝐵B, and 𝐶 C: 𝑃(𝐴∩𝐵∩𝐶)=𝑃(𝐴)⋅𝑃(𝐵∣𝐴)⋅𝑃(𝐶∣𝐴∩𝐵)\n",
    "P(A∩B∩C)=P(A)⋅P(B∣A)⋅P(C∣A∩B)\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Conditional Probability\n",
    "Definition: Conditional probability is the probability of an event 𝐴A given that another event 𝐵B has already occurred.\n",
    "Formula: 𝑃(𝐴∣𝐵)=𝑃(𝐴∩𝐵)𝑃(𝐵)P(A∣B)= P(B)P(A∩B)\n",
    "    \n",
    "6. Continuous Random Variables\n",
    "Definition: A continuous random variable can take any value within a range, often representing measurements such as height, weight, or temperature.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Bernoulli Distributions\n",
    "Definition: A Bernoulli distribution represents a random experiment with exactly two possible outcomes (e.g., success or failure).\n",
    "Formula: For a random variable 𝑋X, 𝑃(𝑋=1)=𝑝P(X=1)=p and 𝑃(𝑋=0=1−𝑝\n",
    "                                                               P(X=0)=1−p.\n",
    "8. Binomial Distribution\n",
    "Definition: A binomial distribution represents the number of successes in a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials.\n",
    "Formula: 𝑃(𝑋=𝑘)=(𝑛𝑘)𝑝𝑘(1−𝑝)𝑛−𝑘P(X=k)=( kn)pk(1−p) n−k\n",
    "where 𝑛 n is the number of trials, 𝑘 k is the number of successes, and 𝑝 p is the probability of success in each trial.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Poisson Distribution\n",
    "Definition: A Poisson distribution gives the probability of a given number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space, with events occurring independently and at a constant rate.\n",
    "Formula: 𝑃(𝑋=𝑘)=𝜆𝑘𝑒−𝜆𝑘!P(X=k)= k!λ k e −λ\n",
    "where 𝜆 λ is the average rate of occurrence.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Covariance\n",
    "Definition: Covariance measures the extent to which two random variables vary together.\n",
    "Formula: Cov(𝑋,𝑌)=𝐸[(−𝜇𝑋)(𝑌−𝜇𝑌)]Cov(X,Y)=E[(X−μ X )(Y−μ Y​ )]\n",
    "\n",
    "11. Correlation\n",
    "Definition: Correlation is a standardized measure of the linear relationship between two variables, ranging from -1 to 1.\n",
    "Formula: 𝜌𝑋𝑌=Cov(𝑋𝑌)𝑋𝜎𝑌ρ X,Y =σ ​ σ ​ Cov(X,Y)\n",
    "                                                               \n",
    "12. Sampling with Replacement\n",
    "Definition: Sampling with replacement means each sample is returned to the population after selection, allowing it to be chosen again.\n",
    "Example: Drawing a card from a deck, recording it, then returning it to the deck before the next draw.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. Sampling without Replacement\n",
    "Definition: Sampling without replacement means each sample is not returned to the population after selection, preventing it from being chosen again.\n",
    "Example: Drawing a card from a deck and not returning it before the next draw.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. Hypothesis\n",
    "Definition: A hypothesis is a testable statement about a population parameter.\n",
    "Example: “The average height of students in a certain school is 5.6 feet.”"
